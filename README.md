# Mouse-Race
University of Bath EEE 2nd Year Module on Professional Engineering.

Pre-allocated group project of IMEE and EEE students. Project aim is to design a race car (mouse) that will follow a wire (racetrack) overcoming quick turns, long turns, up slopes and down slopes with no human interference. 

Two design methods could be chosen (analogue or digital), with the design team opting for a digital system to allow for quick iterative testing to the PID controlled system.

The mouse would use two hall effect sensors to locate the wire. The location of the wire relative to the central point between the sensors would determine the speed of the two wheels separately. Changing the wheel speed relative to one another allowed for cornering and increased straightline speed.

An Arduino Uno board was used for control of the mouse.
